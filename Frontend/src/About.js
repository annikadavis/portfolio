          Hi, I’m Annika. I’m a junior full stack web developer based in Berlin,
          with a passion for art and technology. I believe in technology as a
          tool for collaboration, self expression, democracy, and accessibility.
          <br />I hold a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from Wild
          Code School Berlin, and a Master’s Degree in Art History from the
          University of British Columbia. I have over 7 years of experience
          working in the creative field, and am proficient in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React, the Adobe Creative Suite, and Figma. On the back
          end, I have experience with Express, Node.js, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
          <br />I have lived and worked in several cities around the world,
          including New York City, Tokyo, Vancouver, and now Berlin. My native
          language is English, but I am also proficient in Japanese, and
          currently studying German.
          <br />
